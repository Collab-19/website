# Collab 19

### How we built this.

Collab19 was built as  in an effort to create a better paradigm for fundraising and distribution. 

In early March, members of [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/), [Abridged](https://www.abridged.io/) and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) got together to create a solution to quickly and transparently distribute resources to communities acutely affected by COVid-19. We wanted to develop the easiest way to empower any group of people to collect and distribute resources in channels where coordination already happens. 

We first began with a governance token using Uniswap, but quickly recognized the need for a more user-friendly and less plutocratic platform. In response, we created [Collab19](https://t.me/collab19_bot) using the user-friendly Abridged platform, Aragon templates, and [Wyre](https://www.sendwyre.com/). This system allows anyone, including non-crypto users, to join a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), donate funds into the DAO, and then decide as a group how to allocate those funds, all without ever leaving Telegram. 

### The problem with giving today.

‚ÄúBig philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged‚Ä¶ Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality.‚Äù ‚Äì review of [Just Giving](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183497/just-giving) by Rob Reich

DAOs are online organizations that provide a way for people to coordinate collective resources in a transparent way.

### What is Collab19?

Collab 19 is a DAO built on top of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) that fights COVid-19.

### Why a DAO?

By creating a decentralized autonomous organizataion (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COVid-19. The Collab19 DAO created a democratic system of participation for anyone who has onboarded via the Collab19_bot interface to vote and democratically decide on how to best distribute funds to people in need.
