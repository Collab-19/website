# Collab 19

### What

Collab 19 is a DAO created to help fight COV19.

### Why is it a DAO?

By creating a decentralized autonomous organizataion to fight COV19, people from all over the world can come together to fight COV-19. By buying tokens you're providing a pool of capital that can then be used to donate to charities that are fighting COV-19. Since the tokens are sold on an open market, you can also speculate on the amount of people who will donate. You can always cash out your tokens against the curve to redeem some of the underlying collateral, or you can hold the C19 tokens as proof of support. Token holders can vote on when the DAO redeems it's C19 tokens (half of the supply) as well as where to send funds after tokens are redeemed.
