# Collab 19

Collab19 was built in an effort to create a better paradigm for fundraising and distribution.

‚ÄúBig philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged‚Ä¶ Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality.‚Äù ‚Äì review of [Just Giving](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183497/just-giving) by Rob Reich

DAOs are online organizations that provide a way for people to coordinate collective resources in a transparent way.

### What is Collab19?

Collab 19 is a DAO built on top of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) that fights COVid-19.

### Why a DAO?

By creating a decentralized autonomous organizataion (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COVid-19. The Collab19 DAO created a democratic system of participation for anyone who has onboarded via the Collab19_bot interface to vote and democratically decide on how to best distribute funds to people in need.
