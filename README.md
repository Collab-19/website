# Collab 19

### What is Collab19?

Collab 19 is a DAO that fights COV19.

### Why a DAO?

By creating a decentralized autonomous organizataion (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COV-19. The Collab19 DAO created 1400 C19 tokens. Collab19 kept half and the rest were put on a Uniswap pool. Every week Collab19 will cash out 100 of it's C19 tokens. You can buy these tokens on Uniswap. When you do you become part of Collab19. You can then vote on how to spend the DAO's treasury. Tokens are sold on an open market so you can cash them out at any time or hold them as proof of support.
